# hello-world
I created this repository to learn from the Github tutorial.
I am a graphic designer without coding skills and I would like to improve my skills by learning to to make websites. I just started to learn HTML, using the free Gymnasium courses. The second course is on Modern Web Design and for the first assignment I have to upload a web page with Github.
